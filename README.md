# Treasure-Island-Text-Adventure-Game

**Description**
A simple Python interactive text-based adventure game where the player makes choices at crossroads, waits or swims, and picks doors to find treasure. Depending on the choices, the player either wins the treasure or encounters game-ending scenarios.

**How It Works
The program:******

1. Welcomes the player with a treasure map ASCII art and introduction.

2. Prompts the player to choose directions and actions via typed input.

3. Uses conditional logic (if-elif-else) to guide storyline branches.

4. Displays different outcomes including winning or losing messages.

 
**Operators and Functions Used**

Operators:

= (Assignment): Assigns user inputs to variables (choice1, choice2, choice3).

== (Equality): Compares user input to specified strings to decide the flow.

. (Dot operator): Called on strings to apply string methods like .lower().

Functions:

print(): Used for displaying messages, ASCII art, and outcome texts to the player.

input(): Captures user input as strings at choice points.

.lower(): A string method that converts input to lowercase to allow case-insensitive comparisons.

if, elif, else: Conditional statements to control the storyline based on user choices.
